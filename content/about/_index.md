> “If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot” -Stephen King

I'm Simon Duchastel, a software developer living in New York City.

For my day job, I'm currently building Android apps. I also have experience with backend systems developing RESTful APIs and microservices in a serverless architecture. If you're interested in my work professionally as a software developer, you can find [my resume here]({{< baseUrl >}}resume.pdf).

On this website, you’ll mostly find me cataloging and reflecting on my hobbies. I mostly write about coding and books. This website is itself a coding project — I built it with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

I also enjoy reading science fiction. Some of my favorite stories include _Foundation_ by Isaac Asimov, _Dune_ by Frank Herbert, and _A Memory Called Empire_ by Arkady Martine. I'll read just about anything science fiction though!

Lastly, I have a deep interest in transit systems (particularly metros/subways) and urban development. In my free time, I often ride trains of various kinds and keep up with transit developments. For a few years I volunteered for [Trails & Rails](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/amtraktrailsandrails/index.htm), a program of the National Parks Service where I rode the Amtrak _Coast Starlight_ from Seattle to Portland and gave presentations about the fascinating history of Washington State to passengers. Since moving to NYC I've had to stop volunteering but am enjoying the abundance of subways and commuter trains in the region!

I’ve had a lot of fun making this website. I enjoy writing posts (both [book reviews]({{< baseUrl >}}categories/book-reviews) and [software]({{< baseUrl >}}categories/software)) and have found that having them publicly available has given me motivation to write more. I hope you enjoy reading as I become a more proficient writer.
