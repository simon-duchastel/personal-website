> “If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot” -Stephen King

I'm Simon Duchastel, a software engineer living in Seattle, Washington.

For my day job, I'm currently building Android apps. I also have experience with backend systems developing RESTful APIs and microservices in a serverless architecture. If you're interested in my work professionally as a software developer, you can find my resume here: [{{< baseUrl >}}resume.pdf](../resume.pdf).

However, on this website you’ll mostly find me cataloging and reflecting on my hobbies. I mainly write about coding and in fact, this website is itself a coding project — I built it with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

I also enjoy reading science fiction. Some of my favorite stories include _Foundation_ by Isaac Asimov, _Dune_ by Frank Herbert, and _A Memory Called Empire_ by Arkady Martine. I'll read just about anything science fiction though!

I'm also interested in transit systems (particularly metros/subways) and urban development. In my free time I'm often riding trains and keeping up with transit developments. I volunteer for [Trails & Rails](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/amtraktrailsandrails/index.htm), a program of the National Parks Service where I ride the Amtrak _Coast Starlight_ from Seattle to Portland and give presentations about the fascinating history of Washington State to passengers.

I’ve had a lot of fun making this website. I enjoy writing posts (both for [software](../posts/) and [book reviews](../reviews/)) and have found having them publicly available has given me the motivation to write more. I hope you enjoy reading I become more proficient writer (including with code).
