![Simon Duchastel](simon-duchastel.jpg#center "Profile Picture of Simon")

Hello, and welcome to my personal website! I'm Simon Duchastel, a software engineer living in Seattle, Washington.

This website is a way for me to catalog and reflect on the stuff I do in my spare time. I mostly write about hobby software projects. This website is itself a hobby project â€” I built it with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

For my day job, I'm currently building Android apps. I also have experience with backend systems developing RESTful APIs and microservices in a serverless architecture. If you're interested in my work professionally as a software developer, you can find my resume here: [{{< baseUrl >}}resume.pdf](../resume.pdf).

I enjoy reading science fiction. Some of my favorite stories include _Foundation_ by Isaac Asimov, _Dune_ by Frank Herbert, and _A Memory Called Empire_ by Arkady Martine. However, I'll read just about anything scifi!

I'm also interested in transit systems (particularly metros/subways) and urban development. In my free time I'm often riding trains and keeping up with transit developments. I volunteer for [Trails & Rails](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/amtraktrailsandrails/index.htm), a program of the National Parks Service where I ride the Amtrak _Coast Starlight_ from Seattle to Portland and give presentations about the fascinating history of Washington State to passengers.
