![Simon Duchastel](simon-duchastel.jpg#center "Profile")

Hello, and welcome to my website! I'm Simon Duchastel, a software engineer living in Seattle, Washington.

Professionally, I mostly develop mobile apps on Android. I have the most experience creating native Android app experiences using Kotlin. However, I've also worked on backend systems developing RESTful APIs in Java and microservices using serverless architecture on AWS and infrastructure-as-code.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading and writing scifi stories. Some of my favorite books include _Foundation_ by Isaac Asimov, _Dune_ by Frank Herbert, and _A Memory Called Empire_ by Arkady Martine. However, I'll read just about anything that can be classified as science fiction!

I'm also passionate about transit systems (particularly metro/subway systems) and urban development. In my free time you'll often find me perusing the latest transit news, reading up on new and innovative transit lines, and riding trains.

This website is a way for me to catalog and reflect on the stuff I do in my spare time. I mostly post hobby software projects I've worked on and scifi stories I've written.

If you're interested in my work professionally as a Software Developer, you can find my resume here: [{{< baseUrl >}}resume.pdf](../resume.pdf).
