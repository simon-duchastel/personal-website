![Simon Duchastel](simon-duchastel.jpg#center "Profile")

Welcome to my site! I'm Simon Duchastel, a software engineer living in Seattle, Washington.

Professionally, I mostly develop mobile applications for Android. I have the most experience creating native app experiences in Kotlin. However, I've also worked on backend systems working on REST endpoints in a Java and microservices in AWS using serverless architecture and infrastructure-as-code.

In my off-time, I enjoy reading and writing science fiction stories. Some of my favorite books are Foundation by Isaac Asimov, Dune by Frank Herbert, and A Memory Called Empire by Arkady Martine. However, I'll read just about anything that can be classified as Science Fiction!

I'm also deeply interested in transit systems (particularly metro/subway systems) and urban development. Outside of work you'll find me perusing the latest transit news, reading up on new and innovative transit lines, and riding trains.

This website is a way for me to catalogue some of the things I do in my spare time and to share them with anyone who's interested. I mostly post software projects I've worked on and scifi stories I've written.
