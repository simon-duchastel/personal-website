![Simon Duchastel](simon-duchastel.jpg#center "Profile Picture of Simon")

Hello, and welcome to my website! I'm Simon Duchastel, a software engineer living in Seattle, Washington.

Professionally, I mainly develop mobile apps. I have the most experience creating native Android app experiences using Kotlin and Kotlin Multiplatform, but I've also worked on backend systems developing RESTful APIs in Java and microservices in a serverless architecture with AWS.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading (and sometimes writing scifi stories). Some of my favorite books include _Foundation_ by Isaac Asimov, _Dune_ by Frank Herbert, and _A Memory Called Empire_ by Arkady Martine. However, I'll read just about anything that can be classified as science fiction!

I'm also interested in transit systems (particularly metro/subway systems) and urban development. In my free time you'll often find me reading up on the latest transit news and riding trains.

This website is a way for me to catalog and reflect on the stuff I do in my spare time. I mostly post hobby software projects I've worked on and scifi stories I've written. This project is itself a hobby project - a website I built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

If you're interested in my work professionally as a Software Developer, you can find my resume here: [{{< baseUrl >}}resume.pdf](../resume.pdf).
