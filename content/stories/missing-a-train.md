Richard thought that he given himself plenty of time. After all, he left his hotel five hours before his flight time – more than enough of time to get to the spaceport. Thirty minutes for getting to <Foo City> station, then a little under an hour for the rapid train to <Foo Planet> Central Spaceport, and finally he’d be on his way up to orbit to meet the shuttle that would bring him back home. Even if he bumbled around like an idiot for two hours, he still had a nice buffer of an hour and a half before he missed his shuttle – plenty of time to stop for a nice meal (not that such a thing existed on <Foo Planet>).

The problem was, bumble around like an idiot is exactly what he’d been doing for the last two hours. Now Richard wanted to kick himself for ever agreeing to come to such a horrible place.

Truth be told, the trip had gone pretty well. There was all the usual bureaucracy that Richard had come to expect in these sorts of affairs. The inspection had went to plan, his tour of the refinery had been pleasant enough, and even the customs officials overseeing the export license had taken the appropriate bribes – all as expected. What he hadn’t expected was for his guide to completely abandon him once it was time for him to leave.

Now, Richard was stuck in one of the smallest train stations he’d ever been to on a completely foreign planet, and had no reasonable way to orient himself. His piece of shit translator module didn’t even translate any of these languages, for crying out loud. That’s how far out he was.

How was he ever going to get home? Was he just going to be stuck here on this planet, on this train station, for months and months until finally his idiotic company realized they hadn’t heard from their export inspector for a while, and gosh wouldn’t it be nice to know where he was or what he was doing or more importantly whether they needed to hire a new export inspector or if they could just save the recruiting costs and use the one they still had? How the hell was he going to get back home?

Richard could feel his heart start to race faster, and instinctively made his way to an empty bench to sit down. “I’ve got to get a hold of myself”, he muttered to himself.

Now that he was sitting down and no longer pacing around the building like the lost traveler that he was, he took a moment to actually take a look around. For a minor station on a backwater planet outside of the Main Sector, <Foo City> station was surprisingly spacious. To be fair, it was nothing close to even the most remote township back on Gilroy, but then again that wasn’t exactly fair comparing this place to the hugely populated trading system Richard called home. Even so, the glass curves of the station roof gracefully swung up to what must have been at least 80 feet high. Between the bustling crowd of travelers and the dirty glass of the ceiling above, security and messenger drones swooped through the air at dizzying speeds, narrowly zig-zagging between the various message boards displaying train arrival times and propaganda vids.

The message boards too were interesting – giant electronic displays 30 feet tall displayed departure times for dozens of trains. He couldn’t read a thing they said (other than the time, he supposed), but from the diversity of symbols on the screen and the rate at which they frantically switched displays to show even more departures he figured this station must have a respectable influence over the region. Also, Richard figured the speakers of this local language had to be able to read pretty damn fast to keep up with that.

Actually, he realized he hadn’t paid the boards much attention when he got in. He was too busy shoving his way to (what he thought had been) his platform – navigating the throng of people who had suddenly flooded the station – to pay any attention to an alien display board that he couldn’t even read anyways. But suddenly he realized something: what if he could read it?

Richard tried to remember back to the that shitty orientation Corporate had forced him to sit through, although now that he was stuck here maybe it wasn’t so useless after all. He fiddled with the translator unit snapped over his right ear, messing with the touch controls until it activated the visual module and started overlaying images over over his sensory field. He’d gotten so used to the weight of the two-inch long circular dome covering the right side of his head and had to use it so infrequently thanks to his guide that he barely even remembered it was there, let alone how to control it. Was it in this sub-menu, or – no, maybe this one, until … * Click *.

Thank god Richard thought to himself as a loading animation popped into view and the visual translator sub-module kicked on. His vision blurred, and for a second he was scared that the visual translation functionality was broken. After all, he shouldn’t expect the company to pay for an actually functioning translator unit now, would he? But all of a sudden, his vision snapped back into focus and Richard breathed a sigh of relief.

Only for it to turn to stone in his throat as the text Unsupported language detected to pop up over the sign of what he could only imagine was a newspaper stand right in front of his field of vision. “Oh you’ve got to be kidding me” Richard swore, rapidly whipping his head up to the huge display board hanging above. To his dismay, the display board read the same: “Unsupported language detected” was overlaid over every piece of text on the sign, with the exception of the numerical departure times on the right.

“Of course not” he said to himself, not particularly caring what any aliens staring nearby would think of a foreigner talking to himself in the middle of the station. “Of course they wouldn’t buy me a useful translator module. I mean why send me to <Foo Planet> with a translator module actually loaded up with the local language when you can save a few bucks buying a module with none of the right language mods. The vocal module didn’t have the right language, why should the visual module be any different?”.

As he turned off the unit, he sank back deeper into his bench to consider his options. Maybe there were local guides or police officers around who could help him? Richard took a quick look around the lobby area that, searching past the mob of bustling travelers to the edges where such helpful people might loiter.

Over by what looked to be one of the platform entrances were two very scary looking soldiers. They wore dark blue fatigues and what Richard recognized as the flag of the reigning political party on their left sleeve. Each carried a huge black energy rifle. Ok, so maybe a little heavily armed for a helpful station agent but hey, soldiers were official and about his best bet of finding some directions off this planet.

After taking a few deep breaths to compose himself, Richard walked towards the soldiers in what he hoped was a non-threatening manner. They didn’t seem to notice him until he was almost right next to them.

“Um, excuse me? I’m trying to catch the Express to <Foo Planet> Spaceport but seem to have gotten a bit lost. Can you help me?”. As he spoke, Richard was dismayed to see that his now reactivated translator module was displaying Selected Language Unavailable on the top right of his field of vision. Here’s hoping these guys speak Galactic Standard he thought to himself.

The soldier on the left made a short series of sounds which to Richard’s ears sounded like two jagged stones scraping together, but which in his three days on <Foo Planet> he had come to recognize as <Fooese>, the dominant language in this area. The translator module unhelpfully blinked Unsupported language detected. The soldier abruptly stopped talking and stared at Richard, evidently waiting for him to reply.

Richard was barely able to meekly eek out, “I’m sorry, I didn’t quite catch that. You don’t happen to speak Galactic Standard, do you?” Noticing again how big and scary their energy rifles were, Richard hoped that using the term Galactic Standard wasn’t some sort of faux-pas on this authoritarian, backwater planet so far removed from the “Standard” of the Galaxy.

The soldier paused again, scrunched her face in what must have been the alien equivalent of a “huh?”, and repeated the same cacophony of sounds Richard had previously heard more slowly this time.

Unsure of what to do, Richard just stood there for a few seconds staring at the two heavily armored soldiers, hoping against all odds that one of them would start speaking something he could understand.

The soldier on the right, who until now had just been standing there impassively like a wall, took two steps towards Richard and brusquely nudged him on his shoulder. At first, he thought they were in the process of arresting him and that he should maybe not have asked the only people with weapons in the whole train hall for help when he realized that the soldier wasn’t arresting him at all. Towards the very back of the station, more clearly visible now that the throng of people had caught their respective trains off to wherever they were going, was a room that was recognizable to all travelers in the galaxy, no mater how foreign. The soldier was nudging him to face what could only have been a help kisok.

“Ah, I see. Well, um, thank you very much, I quite appreciate it. Thank you”. With an objective now in mind, Richard scurried along through the crowd of people towards the welcoming sign of the kiosk. Behind him, the soldiers gave each other a quick glance before shrugging and going back to their routine of impassively scanning the hall.


There was no line for the kiosk, and the attendant behind the counter looked bored staring at a worn-out magazine. That was either very good luck – because Richard could get directions right away and quickly make his way to his rendezvous with the shuttle – or very bad luck – because not having a line meant that the help kiosk was so utterly useless no one bothered with it.

He had regained some of the composure lost talking to the soldiers and so was able to muster a semi-confident “Excuse me” to the attendant as he gently set his briefcase down beside him. The attendant’s eyes continued to peruse the magazine.

A little less certain now, Richard took a half-step forward and asked again more loudly “Excuse me?”. The attendant gave a half-look up and his eyes widened for just a split second, clearly surprised by what must have been the first visitor to his kiosk in quite some time, before recovering his completely bored expression and setting down his magazine.

The attendant opened his mouth to say something and the most guttural, foreign sound Richard had ever heard exited. He had spent three days speaking to various people on <Foo Planet> (albeit with his guide translating), but somehow this attendant sounded even more incomprehensible than the others had.

Pleading for some good luck, Richard asked “You don’ t happen to speak Galactic Standard, do you?”.

The attendant cocked his head to the side and furrowed his brow in a cross of confusion and surprise. If few people visited this help kiosk, then no foreigners from the Inner Republics must have visited. The alien tapped a plastic card dangling from his neck two, three, four times before a chime rung out faintly. It looked like a cheap piece of plastic, not dissimilar to one of those credit chips you gave to kids. The attendant straightened himself and repeated the incomprehensible tones.

This time though, the plastic card emanated a series of complex high-pitched whistling sounds. It almost sounded like something that could be language, but alas not any language that Richard was familiar with. Maybe another one of the many nations here in the Outer Territories?

Richard shook his head. “Sorry – only Galactic Standard.” Almost like an afterthought, as if to justify the shitty planning of going somewhere he didn’t speak an ounce of any language in a six-system radius, he pointed to his translator unit still perched on his ear before making a thumbs-down gesture with his fist. “Mine’s busted.”

The attendant shrugged, then turned his eyes back down to his magazines. Richard started to panic again. “Wait, wait I remember I have something!”. He had almost forgotten – he’d had the foresight to print his itinerary before leaving Gilroy. It was all written in Standard, but he hoped at least the train numbers or names were comparable. “Does this help at all?”, putting it down on the counter in front of him.

The attendant looking somewhat tired of having to deal with this annoying man keeping him from his magazine, looked back up and eyed hesitantly at the paper. After looking it over for an excruciatingly long thirty seconds, he pushed it back to Richard. He said something else in the incomprehensible language and pointed past Richard. 

Richard looked in the direction the attendant was pointing towards a small arch in the opposite corner of the hall. “Umm, so the train is waiting over there, is that it?”, he said, turning back to the attendant. He’d already gone back to reading his magazine, his face the same bored and impassive wall it had been when Richard had approached the kiosk. After about half a minute of non-response, Richard said “all right, I guess so then” and thanked him as he turned and walked towards the arch.

As he approached, he noticed the arch was ornamented with scenes of people holding various tools. A figure of a woman looked like she was holding a rifle, while Richard had no idea what the man besides her was supposed to be holding. The scenes looked like they had at one point been painted bright yellows and blues, but the color was now faded and monochrome. On the outside of the arch was text wrapping in the same undecipherable language as the billboards.

Past the arch was a staircase leading down to a long platform flanked by two recessed pairs of rails. On, either side of the platform were maybe a dozen or so toher identically laid-out platforms – a respectable number for a station of this size. Maybe the designers had overbuilt this area with the expectation of soon-to-be expansions to the network?

The platforms were teeming with people, the edges a wall of people waiting for the next train. A few platforms over Richard saw a swarm of people crowd their way into an awaiting train, a near endless line of people file their way into the staircase separating the upper and lower level of the train until the platform was empty. The lights surrounding the doors started to blink before a second train pulled into the adjacent platform and blocked his view. Every minute or so a train would whiz by dizzyingly fast, blowing a gust of wind across the platforms and causing everyone waiting to rock back and forth as they stabilized and returned to their tedious wait.

With astonishment, Richard realized that there was nothing between him and the rails below. When he walked into the platform area he had been initially surprised at the lack of screen doors, but had assumed that they must have transparent force-barriers separating the platform and the empty area of space where the train arrived. But now he saw that people were sticking their heads – their heads! – out over the rails to try and sneak a glimpse at the arriving train in the distance.

What stopped people from falling into the pits and getting bulldozed by an oncoming train? worried Richard, his heart rate rising. He had to find his train and get on it, and quickly before he freaked out any more than he already was.

Craning his neck, Richard struggled to look over the masses of people. The people ahead of him all appeared to be workers returning home from their jobs, bundled in scarves and long-coats and carrying small briefcases and book bags. No one that looked like they were off to take a long trip off-system at the spaceport.

If I can just find someone with a heap of luggage thought Richard, that should be good enough to know I’m going to the spaceport. It’s better than just randomly guessing which train to get on at least.

Richard was standing on the first platform from the entrance of the arch, which happened to also be the one with the most people. He waited there impatiently as slowly train after train passed by on adjacent platforms. Every time a new train pulled into the station, he would stick his head up out of the crowd in a desperate attempt to see if maybe this new train would be the one to take him to his destination. Invariably he would decide that it wasn’t the right train. It would either be too short to reasonably be the Central Spaceport bound train, would speed past the platform and out of the station without stopping, or simply just be too full for Richard to have any hope of squeezing onboard. Each time he uncertainly decide that no, he should just stay on his current platform and wait patiently for his train to arrive. Well, what he hoped was his train.

After maybe half an hour of waiting and just as he was about to say “Fuck it” and jump on whatever train pulled into the station next just to see where it would go, finally the electronic chimes of a train pulling aside the platform startled Richard into action.

Turning wildly in the direction of the sound, Richard saw a huge double-height engine glide effortlessly by the platform mere inches from the faces of the unfazed commuters patiently waiting its arrival. The electricity of the rails crackled gently as the train slid by. The train was longer than most of the others he had seen in the last thirty minutes – much longer in fact, almost a thousand feet long. This must definitely be the one Richard thought to himself.

The train slowed down to a crawl and then finally stopped with a satisfying * clunk *. People all around him were eagerly crowding towards the rows of doors to the train now in front of them where just a moment before a six-foot drop to the rails below had been. To his surprise though, a pleasant three-count chime rung out across the platform before being followed by a long guttural announcement in whatever language the soldier had been talking to him in. Every where around him people giving out short yelps in exclamation and slowly, the whole crowd started to stream off the platform back the way he had come.

Puzzled and frightened at this might mean for his journey, Richard waited another few minutes as the people around him glumly made their off the platform and down the steps through the arch, or in some cases to another adjacent platform. A few people still occupied the platform alongside him, all either very confused like he was or else visibly angry.

Then, to his complete shock, the right in front of him began to inch forward as the train slowly restarted its engines groaned back to life and the electric sizzle of the wheels-on-rail came back to life. The doors of the train glowed in a menacing red outline as they remained firmly shut.

As the train started to pull out of the station in a slowly, gliding motion, Richard pulled up the time functionality on his translator unit and was dismayed to see that it had already been waiting more than an hour between the talk with the soldiers, the man at the help kiosk, and waiting for this goddamned train. There was no way he was going to make his connection with the shuttle at this point. And so as the train left, so too did Richard’s last glimmer of hope.


Feeling completely demoralized and disheveled, Richard sat down at the first bar-looking establishment he could find. Luckily, there were plenty just past the end of the platforms where a staircase led out to what must be the rest of the city. Richard plopped himself down on the bar stool and before the bartender had a chance to ask him something in that incomprehensible language, simply pointed at one of the flickering electronic displays hanging above the bar. If there was any luck to be had on this godforsaken planet, maybe it would turn out to be a half-decent drink.

The bartender put his hands in his back pockets and nodded, turning around and out through the back. When he returned a few minutes later with the biggest jug of brownish fizzy drink Richard had ever seen, he dropped it recklessly down on the stool in front of Richard. Satisfied that at least he had something to drink now, he started sunk down lower on his stool and absently stared ahead at the video screen the bartender was watching while starting to nurse his drink, keeping the panic slowly forming in the pit of his stomach at bay with sips of surprisingly delicious brown liquid.

Richard was just about finished with his drink, a dull haze of drunkenness fully formed now in the back of his skull, when he realized he really had to figure out what the hell he was doing. He was stuck on a foreign planet with zero knowledge of how to speak any of the local languages, no translator, a non-functioning translator unit, and now probably no way to get off-planet. Who was going to help him? Where would he stay tonight? He was pretty sure he could get back to the hotel (he was lucky that he had stayed only an express service away from the train station), but then what? Live out the rest of the cycle in a cramped hotel room subsisting on the hotel bar until his credit account ran out, and hopefully by then someone would notice he was gone and come fetch him? Sounded like a pretty shit sitatuation to him, sounded like he was well-and-properly fucked.

At that moment, Richard heard a cheery beep-beep! sound softly in the back of his skull. Then, In a somewhat robotic but flawless Galactic Standard he heard: “– telling you, this place is quite excellent. They are the only place I’ve found in this system that has good beer, and their Spice Bread is quite passable as well”. Confused, he looked around just as two short men plopped down on the bar stools next to him. Despite the fact that their round faces barely made it above the counter, they ordered two Triple-Empire Ales (whatever the hell that was) with the air of confidence only natives have. Except they did it in Galactic Standard!

A flash of adrenaline shot itself into Richard’s heart as he whipped his head up at the old-fashioned clock hanging above the bartender to check the time. An hour fifteen before he needed to be at the spaceport – if he hurried, he might be able to make it before his flight left! It’d be tight, but it was the first piece of good luck Richard had had in the last six hours. As calmly as he could manage in his energized state, Richard turned to face the two short men who took a seat next to him. “Excuse me, I’m terribly sorry to bother you but I’m a little bit lost, and my translator unit seems to have fritzed out on me. You wouldn’t happen to know the way to the express headed for <Foo City> Spaceport? I’m awfully close to missing my flight”.

The men exchanged a brief glance before shrugging and returning to their drinks. “Apologies, we don’t speak Galactic Standard”.

Realization hit Richard. Of course they weren’t speaking Galactic Standard – they were probably speaking one of the Western Trade Dialects. Suddenly, he remembered that meeting he had had with one of the sub-municipalities on the Western Arc, short men and women who had looked just like these two had. Frantically, Richard fidgeted with the unit on the right side of his ear, eagerly thumbing through the controls until his retinas glowed with Now translating into: Western Trade Language (Standardized).

“So sorry, my translator unit hasn’t been working. Can you please help me find the express train to the Spaceport? I’m about to miss my flight”.

The trader on the right sunk deeper into his chair, clearly trying to avoid talking to the crazy ma. The other trader, on the other hand, gave his companion a quick pat on the back before saying “Ah, no apologies needed fellow traveler. However, I must give my condolences. There’s been an accident on the northern spur – can you believe these people have yet to even begin transitioning to hyper-magnetic rail? At any rate, that is also the reason we’re here too. Grabbing some refreshments while the engineers get the train running again, most certainly at least a few hours”.

Richard’s head dropped a few inches as he processed the news the man was giving him. Just his luck, that just as he found his way out of here it ended up having never even pulled into the station. Was this whole planet out to get him?

“However,” the trader continued, “we have the good fortune of being rerouted on a spicing ship. You must originate from one of the Inner Republics, is that correct? Is that where your next travels take you?”

Gerald nodded. “Back home to <Gilroy>.”

“Ah, what an excellent coincidence! Our spicing ship is stopping two systems from Gilroy, very close indeed! It’s running back empty with plenty of room onboard. My companion and I” – the trader gestured casually to the other trader sitting next to him – “would be quite pleased to allow you passage alongside us. For a nominal fee, of course”. At this point, it was clear the second trader had caught on to what his friend was doing and had gone from standoffishly staring into his drink to cheerfully smiling towards Richard. “500 credits. What say you, fellow traveler?”

Ordinarily, there was no way Richard would ever pay such a ridiculous price. But he had no idea how (or when) he would get off this godforsaken planet otherwise, and fuck it – the company could pay for it after the flaky guide and shitty translator unit they stuck him with.

“What the hell, you’ve got yourself a deal.” Richard thumped his hand palm-faced down on the table in what he hoped was his correct recollection of the Western Traders’ custom of closing deals.

To his satisfaction, both traders did the same table-thumping gesture in tandem. “Excellent, my colleague and I are so pleased to hear this! Please, join us in our beer. Our ship should arrive within the quarter-day, and after that we shall be on our way!”

 
As the shuttle made its final approach to the ship that would take him home, Richard looked back at the planet he was so glad to be slowly pulling away from. At this height 500 miles above the train station he was previously stuck on, the planet below didn’t look so bad. In fact, it looked quite beautiful.

What few oceans there were seemed to twinkle in the darkness of space, almost outshone by the web-like tendrils of glittering city lights. The lights etched an interconnected graph across the vast landmasses of <Foo Planet>, mesmerizing in the seemingly random patterns and interconnections they formed. Funny to think that along some small segment of one of those string of lights was the rail line that hours before he ought to have taken to his own shuttle. Soon, those lights would be joined by even more interconnections bringing even more lights, until the whole planet would be covered with not a graph of lights but a blanket of them. If Richard’s business here on <Foo Planet> was any indication, this backwater planet off the Western end of the Central Planets was just beginning to properly modernize. Maybe this whole ordeal will be prevented in the future.

He sighed, and turned away from the view-screen. In a few standard days he’d finally be back home in <Gilroy>, far away from <Foo Planet>. It’d be good to finally be somewhere with good cheese bread, signs that he could actually read, and trains that didn’t get derailed and actually brought you to where you needed to be. Until then though, Richard sank deeper in his makeshift seat the traders had set aside for him and fantasized of all the things he was going to indulge in once he finally made it back home. Fantasized, and thought of all the colorful words he’d use with management telling them to pick a better planet to expand operations to next time.
