Twenty years ago, my father and cousin bought the domain duchastel.com (my last name is Duchastel). Initially they hosted bios for some of our family members on it, but in the last few years we haven't done much with it. I'm thankful to them for buying and holding onto that domain all this time though, as it now gives me an opportunity to build and manage my own website with a sleek domain name.

I like the idea of having a personal website which is [firstname].[lastname].com. In fact, since I published this website a few of my family members even reached out to me asking if they could get their own subdomain too.

## Goals

I had a few high-level goals which motivated me to build this website

1. Make my resume publicly accessible on the internet so that it's easier to share out
2. Encourage myself to write more by having a place to post publicly accessible blog posts (and in the future, maybe scifi short stories)
3. Learn more about the web by building a website more-or-less from scratch and managing my own web infrastructure
