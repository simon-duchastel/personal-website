As I put this website together, I think it's only fair to include some software projects I've worked on in the past. (It also helps beef up the site until I actually do some interesting things).

So with that, here are some of the projects I dug up from my high school and college days. None are particularly spectacular, but my philosophy is that the things you do in your free time don't have to be spectacular. If they bring you joy that's enough, and if you learned something along the way even better!

## Advent of Code 2020

In 2020 I participated in the [Advent of Code (AoC)](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about). I didn't complete it (I got to day 11/24), but it was a fun little exercise to do after work to take my mind off things.

My solutions weren't very clever. I often took the naive approach or the close-to-naive approach. Since I write code all day long though, it was nice to write code without consequence. I learned a few things:
- how functional program with _fold()_ is supposed to work, and that I really like it.
- Kotlin has some really nice quality-of-life things included in the language.
- that I want to continue doing AoC next year!

## Unfinished Nebula Game

At the end of the senior year in high school and off-and-on in college, a friend of mine (Ray Fung) and I worked on a small little game called Nebula. It never really got anywhere and it was more of an opportunity to mess around with Unity than anything, but it was fun to work with him and figure out how games worked. (Not that ours was particularly complicated - I'm proud of what we did, but it's a fairly simple game and still has plenty of bugs).

The game consists of a small spaceship slowly rotating around an asteroid, and when you tap on the screen the rocket shoots off in the direction it was pointed. The rocket either collides with a new asteroid and starts spinning around it, or flies off into space and you lose.

We used the Unity Game Engine to make the game for mobile and wrote our code in C#. I honestly don't remember much of the technical details other than I'm pretty sure we didn't do things 100% by-the-book when it came to Unity. At least, I certainly didn't - I think Ray knew more about Unity and Game Development than I did. It was fun to mess with things and get something that was semi-working in the end though, and I learned more about what building (simple) games look like.

It doesn't do much, but we got our friend to do the art on it and that alone is cool enough to refer back to.

## CropConnect

At the very beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic, I was stuck in a tiny 100 square foot student apartment in [Lausanne, Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne). I was mid-way through a study abroad program at the nearby University, ÉPFL. Although I eventually managed to return home to the US rather than wait it out in my tiny Swiss apartment (a very smart choice in retrospect), I was still both very busy with my last schoolwork and interested in a distraction from the ongoing pandemic.

Some friends from ÉPFL contacted me about a hackathon the university had put together and asked if I was interested in participating. I let them know I had limited time but would be interested to use it as an opportunity to mess with web development (something I was and still am very bad at).

CropConnect was what came out of that, which wasn't much. It was more of a fun excuse to bash my head against Ruby-on-Rails over the weekend than it was anything serious. I learned some basic Ruby syntax though, so overall I consider it a win.
