This year . Can you tell I really like Kotlin?

I used Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) last year and gave [some of my thoughts here](http://localhost:1313/projects/advent-of-code-2021/#kotlin-multiplatform). My thoughts on KMP overall mostly haven't changed. I will say that the ecosystem appears to be maturing, which is good. There are still a lot of rough edges and a long way to go, but I'm excited for KMP to continue to evolve!
