As I put this site together, I think it's only fair to include some software projects I've worked on in the past. (It also helps beef up the site until I actually do some interesting things, which I suspect won't be for a while).

So with that, here are some of the projects I dug up from my high school and college days. None are particularly spectacular, but my philosophy is that the things you do in your free time don't have to be spectacular. If they bring you joy that's enough, and if you learned something along the way even better!

## Advent of Code 2020

In 2020 I participated in the Advent of Code. I didn't complete it (I got to day 11/24), but it was a fun little exercise to do after work to take my mind off things.

My solutions weren't very clever - in fact, far from it. I often took the naive approach or the close-to-naive approach. Since I write code all day long though, it was nice just to write code without consequence. I learned a few things:
- how functional program with 'fold' is supposed to work, and that I really like it.
- that I want Kotlin has some really nice quality-of-life things included in the language.
- that I want to continue doing AoC next year!

## Unfinished Nebula Game

At the end of the senior year in high school and off-and-on in college, a friend of mine (Ray Fung) and I worked on a small little game called Nebula. It never really got anywhere and it was more of an opportunity to mess around with Unity than anything, but it was fun to work with him on that and figure out how games worked. (Not that ours was particularly complicated - I'm proud of what we did, but it's a fairly simple game and still has plenty of bugs).

The game consisted of a small spaceship slowly rotating around an asteroid, and when you tapped on the screen the rocket would shoot off in the direction it was pointed. The rocket either collided around a new asteroid and started spinning around it, or flew off into space and you lost.

We used the Unity Game Engine to make our mobile game and wrote our code in C#. I honestly don't remember much of the technical details other than I'm pretty sure we didn't do things 100% by-the-book when it came to Unity. At least, I certainly didn't - I think Ray knew about Unity and Game Development than I did. It was fun to mess with things and get something that was semi-working at the end though, and I learned more about what (simple) games look like.

It doesn't do much, but we got our friend to do the art on it and that alone is cool enough to refer back to!

## CropConnect

At the very beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic, I was stuck in a tiny 100 square foot student apartment in [Lausanne, Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne). I was in the middle of doing a study abroad program at the nearby University, ÉPFL. Although I eventually managed to return home to the US rather than wait it out in my tiny apartment (a very smart choice in retrospect), I was still both very busy with my last schoolwork while also interested in a distraction from the ongoing pandemic.

Some friends from ÉPFL contacted me about a hackathon the university had put together about and asked if I was interested in participating. I let them know that I had a limited time but would be interested to use it as an opportunity to mess with web development (something I was and still am very bad at).

CropConnect was what came out of that, which wasn't much. It was more of a fun hobby over the weekend to bash my head against Ruby-on-Rails than it was anything serious. I learned some basic Ruby syntax though, so overall I consider it a win.
