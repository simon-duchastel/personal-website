# Simon's Personal Website

This is my website, hosted at https://simon.duchastel.com and built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

Run the helper tool by calling `./website`. The tool can be built using `make` (you must have [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) installed). [See here](https://github.com/simon-duchastel/website-upload-tool) for more information about the tool.
